A daemon is a process with the following characteristics:
-􏰀 It is long-lived. Often, a daemon is created at system startup and runs until the system is shut down.
􏰀- It runs in the background and has no controlling terminal. The lack of a control- ling terminal ensures that the kernel
   never automatically generates any job-control or terminal-related signals (such as SIGINT, SIGTSTP, and SIGHUP) for a
   daemon.

Example:
cron: a daemon that executes commands at a scheduled time.
sshd: the secure shell daemon, which permits logins from remote hosts using a secure communications protocol.
httpd: the HTTP server daemon (Apache), which serves web pages.
inetd: the Internet superserver daemon which listens for incoming network connections on specified TCP/IP ports and
       launches appropriate server programs to handle these connections.
